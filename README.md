This repository is organized in two folders where you can find scripts and data
to reproduce paper results regarding the analysis of the **Synthetic** and 
**PRMT5** datasets. 

Please note that for the Synthetic dataset there is a BAM folder of 292Mb to 
run ASpli from scratch. You can use much light-weighted pre-computed results if
you just want to reproduce the paper figures.
