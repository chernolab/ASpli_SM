# Supplementary material for ASpli2 paper

- `simulation.xlsx`: spreadsheet with information about the simulation (e.g. mean mRNA numbers per gene, 
simulated expression fold changes, variant profiles, etc) included in `AT1_ES-IR-Alt3ss-Alt5ss.Rdata`.

- `lASbins.RData` stores two objects internally used by `run_comparison.R` script :
-- `lVariantBins` (information about gene models and bins)  
-- `lASbins` (expected changes for alternative exons according the simulation)
